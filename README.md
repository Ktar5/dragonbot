Sup, it's Carter, the person who created this bot, and the Dungeons & Dragons @ SJSU club.
If you're reading this it probably means that you need to modify or use this bot in some way, shape, or form.

The most important thing about this bot is that log.txt and token.txt stay in the .gitignore, as we don't want to go DOXXing everyone who's a part of the club, nor do we want to compromise the security of our Discord bot.
In order to run this bot, you need a security token (for example: ZbM0OTg2MzQfkwcwMTMwOTY0.XazkQg.89n4_jFzFB5YppfffSC52W76Ps0). And you need to place that in the root directory in a file titled token.txt
